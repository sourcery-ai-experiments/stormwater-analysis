        Identifies the segments of the network system (from `all_traces`) where overflowing occurs.

        For each trace in `all_traces`, the function identifies the sections (conduits) where
        the maximum filling height has been exceeded (identified by `overflowing_pipes`).
        The output is a dictionary that contains these segments of overflowing. For each identified
        segment, the trace from the first conduit with overflowing to the last one is included.

        The dictionary keys are outfall IDs and the values are dictionaries where:
        - The dictionary keys are conduit IDs where overflowing occurs.
        - The dictionary values are the corresponding conduit's position in the trace.

        Finally, for each outfall, a trace is generated from the first to the last overflowing conduit.

        Returns
        -------
        dict
            A dictionary where the keys are outfall IDs and the values are traces from the first to
            the last conduit where overflowing occurs. Each trace is a list of tuples, where each
            tuple represents a conduit and the nodes it connects in the form (inlet_node, outlet_node, conduit_id).

        Notes
        -----
        This method requires that `self.all_traces()` and `self.overflowing_pipes()` be defined
        and return appropriate values. Specifically, `self.all_traces()` should return a dictionary
        of all traces and `self.overflowing_pipes()` should return a DataFrame of overflowing pipes.
